# Youtube-Account-Binge
Looking for all/old videos of a user on Youtube is a pain, that's why I created this using python and PyQt.

Uses the Youtube Api to get titles and links for all videos a user has uploaded. 
The username, links and titles are stored in textfiles so after you close it, the data is still there.

The UI was created in QT and ported to python using PyQT.
I used pyinstaller to get a .exe file to run it on windows without python installed.
The batch script runs the command to create the exe file.
